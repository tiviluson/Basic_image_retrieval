# Basic_image_retrieval

A sample project to survey some simple image retrival methods based on different metric functions.
For a more advanced step, `Chroma` and its APIs will be used to embed the images, store them in a vector database, and query for relevant text and images.
Check `Basic_Image_Retrieval.ipynb` for further info.
